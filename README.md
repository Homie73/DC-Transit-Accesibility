## What is this repository made for?
We made this repository to publish our Research Narrative, Analysis, Visual Outputs, and Interactive Web Application.

## Research Narrative
Our Research Narrative, a crucial component of our work, provides a detailed introduction, analysis, and conclusion, offering a comprehensive overview of our research process and findings. This narrative is accessible via this link.

## Analysis
Our intricate analysis process involved coding in Python to process multiple Geospatial datasets. We then calculated and found our target variables, exporting the processed datasets as Shapefiles and Data Tables for visualization in third-party programs. You can explore these detailed analyses via the button below.

## Visual Outputs
Some of our Visual outputs can be found in our Research Narrative. However, we created 40+ maps and charts to answer our research questions, which you can view below or download via this link.

## Interactive Web Application
The final part of our project was to create an interactive platform to publish our findings. To achieve this goal, we used ArcGIS Online's Dashboard and Experience Builder. You can view this application via this link.

## What's next?
Even though we found the answers to our research questions, many others were raised during this time. Hence, we decided to keep this research going and publicize this repository and our data to attract other interested researchers.
One of these questions was:
Despite the factual data showing that current affordable housing projects are planned or built in Washington, DC, what percentage of them are actually completed?
